📌 Project Title

SmartRoute.AI – Intelligent Inter-State Budget Travel Planner for Students

📖 Project Overview

SmartRoute.AI is an AI-based travel planning system designed specifically for students. Unlike traditional travel apps that provide generic suggestions, this project focuses on budget constraints, student preferences, and practical travel routes. The system generates personalized travel itineraries including destination suggestions, hotel stays, food options, and experiences using structured datasets and AI logic.

This project was developed as part of the AICTE – Edunet Foundation | IBM SkillsBuild Internship (AI & ML).

🎯 Problem Statement

Students often struggle to plan trips due to:

Limited budgets

Lack of personalized recommendations

Overwhelming and generic travel suggestions

SmartRoute.AI addresses this by using AI-driven recommendations tailored to student needs.

🚀 Features

Personalized inter-state travel itinerary generation

Budget-aware hotel and place recommendations

Dataset-driven suggestions (cities, hotels, food, experiences)

Clean and modular project structure

Streamlit-based interactive interface

🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Framework: Streamlit

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy

AI Concepts: Rule-based logic + Generative AI concepts

Data: CSV-based structured datasets

📂 Dataset Used

City dataset

Tourist places dataset

Hotel dataset

Food & experiences dataset
(All datasets are cleaned and preprocessed before use.)

🧠 How It Works (Simple Flow)
